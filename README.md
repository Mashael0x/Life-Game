# Life Game

### this repo is dedicated to our project in AI Artathon 2.0.


we are a team of 3 people on artist and two AI developers, our work is inspired by a Series called Squid Game which opens too many questions and thoughts about humans behavior.
our artist Reem draw this piece of art.

We used Neural Style Transfer to transfer another art of Reem to the same style of the previous work.

and this is the result:

we wanted to make further work by producing an art using **Big Sleep** and do a style transfer so it takes the same prvious style but due to time limitations of the first stage of artathion we couldn't do it, we write in the prompt: "we always see the world through filters" and this is the result art:
